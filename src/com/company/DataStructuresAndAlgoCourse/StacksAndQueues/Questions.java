// 1. Implement a stack using a linked list as an underlying data structure (instead of array)
//    What advantage do you think will it have against using arrays? You can use a DoublyLinkedNode.
// 2. Implement two stacks (create a new class, TwoStack) using a single array (say of size 100 - 50 each).
//    How will the push and pop methods change?
// 3. Implement a queue using a linked list as an underlying data structure.
// 4. Write a method which evaluates a mathematical expression represented by a String (e.g. "3 + (2 * 8 + 9)").
//    You can assume that the expressions given are valid. The expression shown above is in the infix notation,
//    which are harder to evaluate in a computer. So you can assume that the expression will be passed in the prefix form
//    (e.g. "+ 3 (+ (* 2 8) 9)"). This way of writing expressions maybe easily evaluated using stacks (one for numbers &
//    one for operator). You may assume that the expression will contain these 5 basic operators (+, -, *, / and %) and all
//    operands will be integers, but the expression may evaluate to a double value because of division.
