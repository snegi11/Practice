//1. Append the last n nodes of a linked list to the beginning of the list.
// Will keeping the length as a member variable inside the LinkedList class, help?

// 2. Write a 'reverse' method in the LinkedList class, which reverses the order of the elements of the list.

// 3. Write a method to find kth element from a singly linked List from the end(not from the head) in one pass.

// 4. Write an algorithm to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. What is the time complexity?
// (You can use the Set provided in the JDK). How will you solve it if additional memory is not allowed?

// 5. Implement an algorithm to delete a node from somewhere in the middle of a SINGLY linked list, given that you have access only to this node (and of course the subsequent nodes).
//  E.g.
//  INPUT: The node 'v' from the linked list u->v->w->x->y->z
//  RESULT: The new list should look like this u->w->x->y->z

// 6. How can you identify if a Linked List is circular? (Think about using two pointers/references)
